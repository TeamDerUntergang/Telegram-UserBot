### If the CI builds pass, but you still get syntax errors when running locally it's most probably not a problem with the source but with your version of python

A modular telegram Python UserBot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Started up as a simple bot, which helps with deleting messages and other stuffs when I didn't possess a smartphone(selecting each message indeed difficult) with a ton of meme features kanged from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.

For configuring this userbot, you can checkout the [Wiki](https://wiki.raphielgang.org)

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions then don't hesitate to contact me in [my support group](https://t.me/SedenUserBotSupport).

Please head to the wiki on instructions to setting it up!
